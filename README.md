this is a web page created by ME using pure HTML and CSS to visualise a social media profile.
if you want to see my demo you can find it all above the page, by creating this page i face many challenges in code like understunding how to use grid , and moreover in the psycho side where i knew how much the consitensy is a key like they say. at the end i discover a new way to host a static web site by using google drive and this will make it 4 ways to host a static website for free.
